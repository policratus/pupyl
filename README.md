## 🧿 pupyl what?

The `pupyl` project (pronounced _pyoo·piel_) is a pythonic library to perform image search tasks (even over animated GIFs). It's intended to make easy reading, indexing, retrieving and maintaining a complete reverse image search engine. You can use it in your own data pipelines, web projects and wherever you find fit!

## 🎉 Getting started
### 📦 Installation
Installing `pupyl` on your environment is pretty easy:
```Shell
# pypi
pip install pupyl
```
or
```Shell
# anaconda
conda install -c policratus pupyl
```
_For installation troubleshooting, visit [troubleshooting](TROUBLESHOOTING.md)._

## 🚸 Usage

You can call `pupyl`'s objects directly from your application code. For this example, a sample database will be indexed and after that, the following image will be used as a query image (_credits_: [@dlanor_s](https://unsplash.com/@dlanor_s)):

![@dlanor_s](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1520763185298-1b434c919102?w=970&q=80)

_`pupyl` also supports using [animated gifs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GIF#Animated_GIF) as query images and can store and retrieve it too._

```Python
from pupyl.search import PupylImageSearch
from pupyl.web import interface

SEARCH = PupylImageSearch()

SEARCH.index(
    'https://github.com/policratus/pupyl'
    '/raw/main/samples/images.tar.xz'
)

# Using, for instance, a remote image. Local images have pretty faster results.
QUERY_IMAGE = 'https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1520763185298-1b434c919102?w=224&q=70'

[*SEARCH.search(QUERY_IMAGE)]
```

_Disclaimer: the example above creates `pupyl` assets on your temporary directory. To define a non-volatile database, you should define `data_dir` parameter._

This will return:
```Python
# Here's the simplest possible result
> [486, 12, 203, 176]
```
With more information and returning image metadata from the results:
```Python
# The results with image metadata
[*SEARCH.search(QUERY_IMAGE, return_metadata=True)]
```
Now an excerpt of the (possible) return is:
```Python
[
    {
        "id": 486,
        "internal_path": "/tmp/pupyl/0/486.gif",
        "original_access_time": "2021-12-03T13:23:47",
        "original_file_name": "icegif-5690.gif",
        "original_file_size": "261K",
        "original_path": "/tmp/tmp3gdxlwr6"
    },
    {
        "id": 12,
        "internal_path": "/tmp/pupyl/0/12.gif",
        "original_access_time": "2021-12-03T13:23:46",
        "original_file_name": "roses.gif",
        "original_file_size": "1597K",
        "original_path": "/tmp/tmp3gdxlwr6"
    },
    ...
]
```
To interact visually, use the web interface:
```Python
# Opening the web interface
interface.serve()
```

Alternatively, you can interact with `pupyl` via command line. The same example above in CLI
terms:

### 🐚 Command line interface
```Shell
# Indexing images
pupyl --data_dir /path/to/your/data/dir index /path/to/images/

# Opening web interface
pupyl --data_dir /path/to/your/data/dir serve

# Searching using command line interface
pupyl --data_dir /path/to/your/data/dir search /path/to/query/image.ext
```

> 💡 Type `pupyl --help` to discover all the CLI's capabilities.
